# ProjectileActivity
Android Projectile Particle Simulation - With Pause Thread Feature

Simulating the motion of a projectile, by initializing the velocity and angle of the projectile.
Features  ::
1) Calculates the (x,y) co-ordinates of the projectile (using the
projectile motion equations)
2) Control Delay/Speed of the calculations (basically sleeping the
thread by that amount)
3) Pause the timer - Main Thread & restart from the given time.
